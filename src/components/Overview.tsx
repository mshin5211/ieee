Here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IEEE represents the second largest student branch in the nation. Though it may seem from the name that we consist of students only from the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, we in fact encompass all different fields and welcome this diversity. Our organization strives to further students professional and educational development through a wide array of opportunities. We host tech talks, info sessions, luncheons, workshops, and socials. We also provide students with the opportunity to work on projects and compete in competitions. IEEE at the University of Illinois is a great way to meet new people, learn new things, and have fun!
